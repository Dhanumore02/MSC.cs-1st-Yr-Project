        <h2>Avocado</h2> 
                    <p> Avocado Ice Cream belongs in your summer survival kit. Luxuriously creamy and utterly scrumptious, it will shock those skeptical of adventurous ice creams with its deliciousness. </p> 
                    <p> Avocado ice cream origins
                        Eating avocado for dessert is popular in places such as Brazil and many countries in Asia. I first encountered avocado ice cream for sale at a local grocery store, while I was living in the Philippines.
                        
                        We are catching on in the United States. Stop by your local Target or Whole Foods, and you may see a brand called Cado. This non dairy avocado ice cream company offers flavors like cookies & cream, salted caramel, lemon, cherry amaretto, java chip, and chocolate mud pie.
                        
                        There’s even a luxury gelato shop in Selfridges in London called Snowflake that makes avocado gelato (avolato) served in the avocado shell with a vegan nut butter stone.</p>

            <h2 >Benefits of Avocado Ice Cream</h2>
           <h3> While you can’t call avocado ice cream healthy in the strictest sense of the term (I wish!), it does have its merits.</h3>
           <p> Like this Oat Milk Ice Cream, it contains healthy fats and lighter swaps, such as using Greek yogurt.</p>
            <p> Thanks to the dark chocolate hunks, this chocolate avocado ice cream has antioxidants!</p>
           <p> It’s dietary friendly. I have tips for you to make vegan avocado ice cream below, and it’s already egg free.</p>
           <p> Avocado ice cream is also a super easy homemade ice cream to make. The batter comes together in your food processor.</p>
        </section>
         
         <p>Method: In a blender or food processor, puree avocado and condensed milk until smooth. Whip cold heavy cream to soft peaks. Add sweet avocado puree to cream. Whip to stiff, firm peaks. Transfer to freezer safe container. Cover and freeze for at least 6 hours.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <p>Greek Yogurt : Another healthy addition! It keeps the amount of heavy cream in this recipe on the moderate size. Be sure to use 2% or whole Greek yogurt. Nonfat would be too icy.</p>
        <p>Lime Juice : It brightens up the flavor and makes the ice cream taste well-rounded. Be sure to use freshly squeezed. This recipe has few ingredients, so each one matters.</p>
        <p>Heavy Cream : Just 1/2 cup is all you need, a very small amount compared to standard ice cream recipes.</p>
        <p>Dark Chocolate Chunks :I just couldn’t help myself… which also happens to be my motto when in the proximity of a carton of ice cream and a spoon. Chocolate and avocado are a marvelous combination.</p>
