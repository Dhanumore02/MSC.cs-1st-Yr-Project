                    <p>Chocolate ice cream is ice cream with natural or artificial chocolate flavoring. One of the oldest flavors of ice creams, it is also one of the world's most popular.
                        While most often sold alone, it is also a base for many other flavors.</p>

                    <p>The earliest frozen chocolate recipes were published in Naples, Italy, in 1693 in Antonio Latini's The Modern Steward. Chocolate was one of the first ice cream flavors, created before vanilla, as common drinks such as hot chocolate, coffee, and tea were the first food items to be turned into frozen desserts.
                        Hot chocolate had become a popular drink in seventeenth-century Europe, alongside coffee and tea, and all three beverages were used to make frozen and unfrozen desserts.
                        Latini produced two recipes for ices based on the drink, both of which contained only chocolate and sugar</p>

                    <h2>About Chocolate Ice Cream</h2>
                    <p>I had been getting recipe requests for adding ice creams since a long time. So, I worked on a few of them and to be honest, this Chocolate Ice Cream recipe was a personal favorite. 
                        Not just that, even at home everyone loves it.
                    </p>
                    <p>This Chocolate Ice Cream does not need a special ice cream maker and gets done without getting whipped twice or thrice. Just make once, freeze and then enjoy. A similar ice cream is this Chocolate Chip Ice Cream.
                    </p>
                    <p>That’s really saving sometime for you and the best part is you can dive right into a decadent yet gluten-free bowl of ice cream, much faster!

                        Another good thing about this Chocolate Ice Cream is that this recipe does not form any ice crystals while setting. Prepare and serve this ice cream whenever required.
                        
                        This Chocolate Ice Cream recipe yields a large block which you can use to make gorgeous sundaes or sinful desserts too.
